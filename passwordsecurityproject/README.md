# Password Security Project (C)

## Overview
This project implements a password security system written in C. It focuses on securely handling user credentials by using safe input methods, password validation, and secure storage concepts.

## Features
- Secure password input and validation
- Simple credential storage (e.g., text file)
- Basic user authentication by matching username and password
- Prevents storing passwords in plain text (using hashing or other methods can be added)
- Demonstrates fundamental password security principles in C

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C
- Standard Libraries: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<ctype.h>`
